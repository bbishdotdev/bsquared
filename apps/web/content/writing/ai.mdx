Giving developers AI is like giving someone an F1 supercar and sticking them in a traffic jam. Tell them to floor it; you don't get there faster. You crash.

![Traffic gif](/writing/ai/traffic.gif)

A strong developer with AI can already ship what a team of a dozen used to. Velocity is compounding, not incremental.

So the real question is:

Are your roads ready for that kind of traffic?

You don't need a faster car. You need a better road system: fewer red lights, fewer toll booths, fewer roundabouts, and more autonomy to move.

Because AI doesn't fix broken systems.
It exposes them.

Code was never the bottleneck. AI is about to prove it.

## Culture first, not tool first

Top-down mandates stall. Bottom-up adoption sticks. Transformation starts with culture, not edicts.

If you're familiar with the Law of Diffusion of Innovation, it's more relevant now than ever.

![Law of Diffusion of Innovation](/writing/ai/innovation.webp)

Real change comes from innovators and early adopters. Not exec decks telling everyone to "use Copilot now." If you want AI to spread, don't force it. Make it obvious, useful, and socially rewarded. Transformation is viral, not scheduled.

Give developers room to experiment. Let them push boundaries. Let them feel the acceleration themselves.

That's how momentum starts.

### What NOT to do

Don't retrofit AI into broken systems and processes. You'll only amplify the dysfunction. Re-architect for an AI-first ecosystem. Slow approvals? Fragile CI/CD? Org full of handoffs? You'll hit those walls harder with AI.

Start with small teams and trust, re-architect for flow. Demand more from your systems.

## Dev excellence is the real accelerator

Code is becoming a commodity. AI can write it faster than any dev can.

The new premium is:

- **Product sense** - Knowing what to build and why
- **Taste & judgement** - Making good decisions FAST, across UX, architecture, and tradeoffs
- **Generalist knowledge** - Seeing and building the whole car, not just the doors

The dev who can go from idea → shipped product with good taste and AI is the one who wins.

You already see this in companies like Stripe, Cursor, or Linear. Small, autonomous product teams own everything from UI to infra. They ship in days, sometimes minutes, instead of quarters. That model becomes insanely powerful when you layer AI on top.

### What's slowing them down?

These are your traffic jams:

- Silos
- Budgeting and planning
- Slow manual processes
- Batched releases
- Indefinite internal dependencies
- "We need a meeting for the meeting" meetings

## Conway's Law is the speed limit

> "Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

- Melvin Conway

Siloed orgs produce siloed software. AI's efficiency, speed, and consistency airbags deploy when operating in silos (multi-app, separated code & teams).

Can you still get some gains inside silos? Sure, but there is now a hard ceiling on how much speed you can unlock when teams, repos, and ownership are fragmented.

Your comms structure and team politics becomes the bottleneck.

Organize teams around outcomes not departments/stacks.

### Micro-services & micro-frontends are toll booths

I've always been skeptical of the "micro" trend. I get why large enterprises went there to maximize reuse, consistency, and scale. But the tradeoffs for developer experience and velocity weren't worth it. How much time did you save using that common service at the cost of more meetings, comms, priority discussions, dependency timelines, resources, etc.?

![Microservice hell](/writing/ai/microservices.gif)

In my head, more dependencies always meant less movement. That's true in life too. You need to move furniture, but you're waiting on that one friend...schedules don't align...now you're bribing them with pizza and beers and trying to sell it as FUN.

If you can move by yourself somehow, you can just move.

For a huge chunk of software, especially CRUD, AI can do the heavy lifting in its sleep. That makes shared services and cross-team dependencies feel even more expensive.

If one team can code 10× faster but still ships at the same rate because they're waiting on other teams, how much did you really improve?

## Speaking of measurements...

In my experience, metrics are incredibly hard to get right AND there is a fundamental misalignment in what different layers of management think they're for. To me, metrics exist for transparency and awareness, to find areas for improvement. But the improvement is different than the metric itself.

To others, metrics becomes the goal.

"AI means we should ship 50% more PRs."
If you were doing 10, now the target is 15.

I've seen this play out over and over: Agile, DevOps, now AI. The moment a transformation starts, the metrics become the target. This is fundamentally flawed. Devs game PRs easily. Make them smaller. Stage more of them. Ship half-finished work. Congrats, your numbers look great while nothing actually gets better.

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

- Goodhart's Law

PRs != value delivered
Velocity != impact

Metrics like PRs should point you towards better questions. Low PRs? What's the impact? What's the Cycle time? High PRs? Same questions.

Metrics shine light on _potential_ inefficiencies, but the metric on its own is neither good nor bad. Track metrics to ask better questions, not to declare fake victories.

If cycle time is fast, defects are low, and customers are happy...do you really care how many PRs someone shipped?

---

## What the road ahead actually looks like

Not that different. It's better to stop speculating and focus on what you can do right now. Even if AI writes 100% of the code, you still need devs directing it. And as it becomes a commodity more and more, demand will explode... Jevons Paradox.

AI just turns the speed dial all the way up. And suddenly everything that was "fine" becomes painfully slow because it demands dev excellence, speed and proper guardrails.

That means the boring stuff still matters. It's still just good software engineering at its core.

**Collapse the feedback loop**

- Ship to prod daily, not monthly, not quarterly
- Automate and enforce real testing (unit, functional, end-to-end). No excuses; it's too easy with AI now. If you want to trust AI with your code, testing is critical.
- Fix your CI/CD (seriously, this is still shockingly bad at a lot of places)
- Give teams autonomy and access to users

**Kill dependencies**

- Organize teams around end-to-end products, not functions
- Each team owns their UI → backend → infra → data
- No handoffs, no meetings, no tickets, no waiting.

**Trust devs as owners**

- One strong dev with Cursor or Claude Code can now orchestrate the work of 6–8 people, but only if they own it, soup to nuts.

### Speed is the new baseline

Speed is underestimated. Wildly underestimated. The "iPad generation" expects touch, swipe, pinch-to-zoom, and distrusts things that do not operate that way.

My bet is the "AI generation" will come to expect bug fixes in hours, not sprints; feature requests accommodated same day; and ultimately real-time bespoke software on demand that adapts to their needs.

This builds trust, this becomes the baseline, and if you're still stuck in traffic, the market won't wait for you to catch up.

### This lane is closing

Right now, we're still in the "early days of the internet" but for AI. The road is still mostly empty, but it won't be for long.

Everyone just got a supercar. The only question now is who actually built a highway.

## Shift happens, are you ready?
