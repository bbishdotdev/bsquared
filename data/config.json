  "intro": "Husband, father, and technologist. Software Engineering leader and chronic entrepreneur. I love building, tinkering, and learning new things. Addicted to coffee and X (Twitter).",
  "bio": "I'm an engineering leader and builder focused on how AI is changing the way software gets built.\n\nI've spent the past decade building client-facing products, scaling engineering teams, and owning architecture and delivery across both enterprise systems and my own startups. I'm most interested in tools and workflows that improve how engineers design, prototype, and ship software.\n\nOver the past year, I've gone deep on AI-native development. I've built reusable AI-assisted workflows, designed internal training programs, and integrated LLMs into my daily development process. This work has fundamentally changed how I approach system design and iteration speed.\n\nOutside of my role at Morgan Stanley, I've founded and built multiple products from scratch, including Forwheel and Rbitrage Capital. I still spend a lot of my time building, experimenting, and learning.",
