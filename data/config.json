  "bio": "I'm a product-minded technologist with `10+ years` of experience building zero-to-one products both professionally and personally. At **Morgan Stanley**, I've led `5 greenfield` client-facing apps across **E*TRADE** and **Morgan Stanley Online**, managing `12 engineers`.\n\nI recently launched an internal AI bootcamp to teach devs how LLMs work and how to best code with them, accelerating adoption across Wealth Management Technology. The training has been a success and is now expanding firm-wide to train `~20k developers`.\n\nI'm also the founder of **Forwheel**, a mobile app helping `150+` food truck owners save time and money. I previously co-founded **Rbitrage Capital**, growing it to `$750K AUM` via crypto trading algorithms.",
